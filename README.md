# Conversational Recipe Recommendation Agent

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed a cognitive dialogue agent focused on the domain of cooking, specifically designed for recipe selection. This agent leverages Google's DialogFlow and builds on the natural conversation framework proposed by Robert Moore. The aim was to create a conversational agent that not only interacts through speech but also supports visual feedback, enhancing the user experience in selecting suitable recipes based on various filters.

The core functionality of this agent is to assist users in selecting a recipe without providing the cooking instructions themselves. This decision allows us to focus on perfecting the conversational aspects of recipe selection, which includes understanding and integrating user preferences like type of ingredients, cooking duration, and type of course. The domain of recipe recommendation presents a complex challenge due to the variety of conversational paths and user expressions, making this a robust testbed for developing advanced conversational capabilities.

## Project Scope

- **Dialogue Management**: Utilizing Google's DialogFlow for managing the flow of conversation and handling user intents.
- **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporating a comprehensive Prolog knowledge base with close to 1,000 recipes and their respective components.
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Implementing sophisticated parsing techniques to accurately capture user preferences and queries.
- **Visual Support**: Enhancing user interaction with visual elements that support the voice-based recipe recommendations.

## Repository Structure

- **Agent Code**: Contains the main logic and algorithms that drive the conversational agent.
- **Entity Directory**: Includes definitions for various entities that the agent can recognize and process in the dialogue.
- **Intent Directory**: Manages different intents that can be triggered during the conversation, detailing how the agent should respond.
